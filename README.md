# Image-Retrieval-
This project is part of the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition module at University of Surrey.
Students are required to use Matlab to implement this project.
The dataset gathers 591 images of 20 classes of different objects e.g. sheep, cow, boat, car and are in RGB color format with different number of pixels.
The objective is to develop a visual search engine to retrieve similar images to the one provided by the user.
This query image is selected from the data set and thus corresponds to one of the 20 classes.
